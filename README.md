# Notes
- In the event that there are no changes to a detected change, e.g. formatting issues, 
  - One commit should be done to updated the files on par with the formatting. It is recommended to use the filediff feature in GitKraken to do this.
  - Then, the 2nd commit would be the actual changes in the schedules.
- All changes should be done at the development branch before going into the master branch.

## Version numbering
- The version numbering should follow this format : v\<year>\<month>\<day>
 - Where \<year>, \<month> and \<day> are the dates where the changes occur
- Only apply tags on the actual change commit. Do not apply if the commit is to cater formatting changes.
